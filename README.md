The TOP html project
This is my first project in The Odin Project Foundation Course.
This is to evaluate my understanding of HTML and how to use git and GitHub successfully.
This project will take a look into working with text, links, images as well as heading and paragraphs.
I am Ibraheem Alawode, learning Full stack web development from The Odin Project.
